<h3 id="minecraft--forge">Minecraft &amp; Forge</h3>

<div class="sam-section">

  <p>Our mission is to make parents more knowledgable and confident about configuring and modifying their Minecraft setup at home. The ideal setup for most kids playing Minecraft consists of an installation of Minecraft and an installation of Forge - the popular mod loader for Minecraft that enables their kids to run mods that they download from the internet.</p>

  <p><em>If at any point, you feel overwhelmed or confused by any of the lingo, look to the great resources for parents section of this website</em></p>

<h3 id="taking-the-first-steps-to-understand-the-world-of-minecraft">Taking the first steps to understand the world of Minecraft.</h3>

<div class="sam-section">

  <p>Considering that the steep learning-curve can greatly weigh in on parents’ willingness, or unwillingness, to learn about Minecraft technology, we suggest parents to enter the Minecraft world observantly. Expect to demystify Minecraft subjects piece by piece.</p>

  <p>Over the course of doing this… you may find that things you thought had some understanding (perhaps by learing from you son or daughter) of were completely mixed up:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Subtlies in Minecraft terminology may become a lot more obvious, for example, mods vs mod-packs.</li>
    <li>Jargon your kid has picked up from various youtubers may completely based off fantasy or of the streamer’s inidividual experience. Their experience may be a way of exciting their fanbase, and some of their videos may be filled with more fiction. It may not at all directly draw from the Minecraft game.</li>
  </ul>

</div>

<p>If you feel your may kid missing out on the fun of playing Minecraft Mods?</p>

<p>Community service for dads and moms.</p>

<p>I will go travel to homes around the city and explain to parents how to install mods for minecraft. This will be a free service.</p>

<p>These parents may not be that interested in learning the intricacies of minecraft and modding. I will explain the greatest of mods and warn them of child stunt growth impending. Childs ability to navigate pc computer mods is synonomous with making network neural connections limiting brain growth.</p>

<p>If at any point they want me to come back and fix additional issues they are having, 60 an hour!</p>

<p>Two sides of a business card. Front side identifying with parent lack of ability to troubleshoot mod/mc issues. Back side catches eye of kid/gamer-youth. Totally minecraft relatable.</p>

    <p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
