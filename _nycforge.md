Business cards

Community service for dads and moms.

I will go travel to homes around the city and explain to parents how to install mods for minecraft. This will be a free service.

These parents may not be that interested in learning the intricacies of minecraft and modding. I will explain the greatest of mods and warn them of child stunt growth impending. Childs ability to navigate pc computer mods is synonomous with making network neural connections limiting brain growth.

If at any point they want me to come back and fix additional issues they are having, 60 an hour!

Two sides of a business card. Front side identifying with parent lack of ability to troubleshoot mod/mc issues. Back side catches eye of kid/gamer-youth. Totally minecraft relatable.
