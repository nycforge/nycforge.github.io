<!-- I've had many kids ask me during my afterschool teaching jobs/hours asking me how to install mods on their computer. Countless/dozens of times i hear kids say, "my parents won't let me download forge because they're afraid of our computer getting a virus". I'd like these kids to become more self sufficient and their parents to be more supportive of them going out and attempting to install forge on their own. -->

<p>If you or someone at your home is working with Minecraft, then you already know that it’s much more than a game. It’s that, yes, but also an artistic experience, a problem-solving challenge, and an incredibly rich enivronment for creating and sharing ideas and modifications</p>

<p>Our mission is to make parents more knowledgeable and confident about configuring and modifying their Minecraft setup at home.</p>

<p>The ideal setup for most players uses <a href="https://files.minecraftforge.net/">Minecraft Forge</a>.</p>

<p>Minecraft Forge (or just plain Forge) is a the popular Mod Loader for Minecraft that enables their kids to run any mods that they download from the internet. Mods can then be downloaded from <a href="https://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft">curse.com</a> and added to the mod folder (this folder is automatically created when you run Minecraft after installing Forge.)</p>

<!-- Considering that steep learning curves can greatly weigh in on parents' willingness to learn about Minecraft tech... -->

<p>Some set out to improve their Minecraft setup, but are discouraged by the multitude of options or the unfamiliar terminology. We’ve built this site to explain, to simplify, and to guide.</p>

<p>Minecraft’s steep learning curve can easily deter parents from becoming more 
invested in attaining a proper setup. We realize some of you are simply too busy to be investing time  to tinker around with your Minecraft setup. That is why we are <a href="#services">free first-time apointments</a>.</p>

<!-- Minecraft's steep learning curve can easily deter parents from becoming more

<!-- We provide __[free first-time apointments](#services)__ to encourage parents to take action. Parents and kids should find common ground in their understanding of Minecraft. Don't be ashamed to become enthralled with what was seemingly a child activity; many adults play Minecraft (competively/seriously), just take a look at streamers on Twitch! Enter the Minecraft world observantly and expect to demystify terminology and technology piece by piece. -->

<!-- Along the way you will probebly need to relearn some subjects you think you understood. It is entirely possible that this misinformation was passed to you from your son or daughter. Take a look at the [common minecraft misconceptions](). -->

<!-- * subtleties of the Minecraft language may become a lot more clear 
    * some examples: mods vs mod-packs
* jargon your kid has picked up from various youtubers may completely based off fantasy or of the streamer's inidividual experience. Their experience may be a way of exciting their fanbase, and some of their videos may be filled with more fiction than truth. Their content or language may not at all be derived from the Minecraft game -->

<!-- If your kids aren't getting to experience the luxuries of modded Minecraft - for instance, the advanced [let's plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFBkUc6tAPk) or [mod spotlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMmto9lZi5I) from direwolf20 - then maybe we can help... -->

Not much.. Just a computer and an internet connection. Oh yes, you'll also need Minecraft.

<hr class="btwnParRule">

Minecraft, along with all its mods, are wonderful social tools that help kids hone their minds to create and adapt to our rapidly growing tech world. It proves to be an incredible educational tool and it provides a great segway into more creative disiplines like design, 3d modeling, animation, illustration, and programming. [Why else would Microsoft bought Minecraft for 3 billion!]() 

We hope to help parents appreciate Minecraft and we'd love to better their abilities to improve and maintain a working Minecraft setup. It's important for their kids to download and test out the latest mods.

If you are at all concerned with your child's future and his or her ability to get job opportunities in programming or design, they should be having regular access to a computer, preferably doing something active (not just watching silly youtube videos or memes). In teaching, all too often we see kids that are banned from computer use at home. They type at much slower rates and computer time at school isn't enough to get them up to speed. As they go through grade-school, computers will be more dominate tool they use. Let's give them a headstart. Minecraft is fun and addicting, but it's incredibly stimulating and very engaging for kids to play. It helps them establish social interactions when playing online and it offers an endless world to create/craft/build complex structures and complex machines. -->

<!-- If your son or daughter is a proficient typist and interested in learning how to make their own Minecraft mods (using the forge api and eclipse), I could setup a modding environment on your computer and give them a few beginner lessons in Minecraft coding. -->

<!-- I couldn't get away sooner because my new well was coming in at Coyote Hills and I had to see about it. That well is now flowing at two thousand barrels and it's paying me an income of five thousand dollars a week. I have two others drilling and I have sixteen producing at Antelope; so, ladies and gentlemen, if I say I'm an oil man, you will agree. Now, you have a great chance here, but bear in mind, you can lose it all if you're not careful. Out of all men that beg for a chance to drill your lots, maybe one in twenty will be oilmen; the rest will be speculators - that's men trying to get between you and the oilmen - to get some of the money that ought by rights come to you. Even if you find one that has money and means to drill, he'll maybe know nothing about drilling and he'll have to hire the job out on contract, and then you're depending on a contractor who'll rush the job through so he can get another contract just as quick as he can. This is... the way that this works.
Man: Well, what is your offer? W-w-we're wasting time.
[crowd responds: "Yes." "Please."]
Plainview: I do my own drilling, and the men that work for me work for me. and they're men I know. I make it my business to be there and to see their work. I don't lose my tools in the hole and spend months fishing for them; I don't botch the cementing off and let water in the hole and ruin the whole lease. I'm a family man. I run a family business. This is my son and my partner, H.W. Plainview.
[indicates H.W]
Plainview: We offer you the bond of family that very few oilmen can understand. I'm fixed like no other company in this field and that's because my Coyote Hills well has just come in. I have a string of tools all ready to put to work. I can load a rig onto trucks and have them here in a week. I have business connections so I can get the lumber for the derrick - such things go by friendship in a rush like this - and this is why I can guarantee to start drilling and to put up the cash to back my word. I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, no matter what the others promise to do, when it comes to the showdown, they won't be there.`

Community service to help mom/dad.. not kids!

I will go travel to homes around the city and explain to parents how to install mods for minecraft. This will be a free service.

These parents may not be that interested in learning the intricacies of minecraft and modding. I will explain the greatest of mods and warn them of child stunt growth impending. Childs ability to navigate pc computer mods is synonomous with making network neural connections limiting brain growth.

If at any point they want me to come back and fix additional issues they are having, 60 an hour!

Two sides of a business card. Front side identifying with parent lack of ability to troubleshoot mod/mc issues. Back side catches eye of kid/gamer-youth. Totally minecraft relatable.
