##Minecraft and the Forge mod loader

Our mission is to make parents more knowledgeable and confident about configuring and modifying their Minecraft setup at home. The ideal setup for most players will have an installation of [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) - the popular mod loader for Minecraft that enables their kids to run mods that they download from the internet. 

This site will use Minecraft terminology/language in order to be concise. Check out the [resources for parents]() section which includes links to many other great starting points for people getting into Minecraft.

<!-- Considering that steep learning curves can greatly weigh in on parents' willingness to learn about Minecraft tech, ... -->

Minecraft's steep learning curve can easily deter parents from becoming more 
invested in attaining a proper setup. We strongly suggest exploring this site to better determine your Minecraft needs at home.

We provide __[free first-time apointments](#services)__ to encourage parents to take action. Parents and kids should find common ground in their understanding of Minecraft. Don't be ashamed to become enthralled with what was seemingly a child activity; many adults play Minecraft (competively/seriously), just take a look at streamers on Twitch! Enter the Minecraft world observantly and expect to demystify terminology and technology piece by piece.

Along the way you will probebly need to relearn some subjects you think you understood. It is entirely possible that this misinformation was passed to you from your son or daughter. Take a look at the [common minecraft misconceptions]().

<!-- * subtleties of the Minecraft language may become a lot more clear 
    * some examples: mods vs mod-packs
* jargon your kid has picked up from various youtubers may completely based off fantasy or of the streamer's inidividual experience. Their experience may be a way of exciting their fanbase, and some of their videos may be filled with more fiction than truth. Their content or language may not at all be derived from the Minecraft game -->
