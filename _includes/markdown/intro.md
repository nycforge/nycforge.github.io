###Minecraft and the Forge mod loader.

<div class="sam-section" markdown="1">

Our mission is to make parents more knowledgable and confident about configuring and modifying their Minecraft setup at home. The ideal setup for most kids playing Minecraft consists of an installation of Minecraft and an installation of Forge - the popular mod loader for Minecraft that enables their kids to run mods that they download from the internet. 

_If at any point, you feel overwhelmed or confused by any of the lingo, look to the great resources for parents section of this website_

###Taking the first steps to understand the world of Minecraft. 

<div class="sam-section" markdown="1">

Considering that the steep learning-curve can greatly weigh in on parents' willingness, or unwillingness, to learn about Minecraft technology, we suggest parents to enter the Minecraft world observantly. Expect to demystify Minecraft subjects piece by piece. 

Over the course of doing this... you may find that things you thought had some understanding (perhaps by learing from you son or daughter) of were completely mixed up:

* Subtlies in Minecraft terminology may become a lot more obvious, for example, mods vs mod-packs. 
* Jargon your kid has picked up from various youtubers may completely based off fantasy or of the streamer's inidividual experience. Their experience may be a way of exciting their fanbase, and some of their videos may be filled with more fiction. It may not at all directly draw from the Minecraft game.
