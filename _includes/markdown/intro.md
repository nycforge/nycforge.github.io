##Minecraft and the Forge Mod Loader

I've had many kids ask me during my afterschool teaching jobs/hours asking me how to install mods on their computer. Countless/dozens of times i hear kids say, "my parents won't let me download forge because they're afraid of our computer getting a virus". I'd like these kids to become more self sufficient and their parents to be more supportive of them going out and attempting to install forge on their own.

dad > If you or someone at your home is working with Minecraft, then you already know that it's much more than a game. It's that, yes, but also an artistic experience, a problem-solving challenge, and an incredibly rich enivronment for creating and sharing ideas and modifications

Our mission is to make parents more knowledgeable and confident about configuring and modifying their Minecraft setup at home.

The ideal setup for most players will have an installation of [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) - the popular mod loader for Minecraft that enables their kids to run any mods that they download from the internet. 

This site will use Minecraft terminology/language in order to be concise. Check out the [resources for parents]() section which includes links to many other great starting points for people getting into Minecraft.

dad > Some set out to improve their Minecraft setup, but are discouraed by the multitude of options or the unfamiliar terminology. We've built this site to explain, to simplify, and to guide.

Minecraft's steep learning curve can easily deter parents from becoming more 
invested in attaining a proper setup. We strongly suggest exploring this site to better determine your Minecraft needs at home.

We provide __[free first-time apointments](#services)__ to encourage parents to take action. Parents and kids should find common ground in their understanding of Minecraft. Don't be ashamed to become enthralled with what was seemingly a child activity; many adults play Minecraft (competively/seriously), just take a look at streamers on Twitch! Enter the Minecraft world observantly and expect to demystify terminology and technology piece by piece.

Along the way you will probebly need to relearn some subjects you think you understood. It is entirely possible that this misinformation was passed to you from your son or daughter. Take a look at the [common minecraft misconceptions]().

<!-- * subtleties of the Minecraft language may become a lot more clear 
    * some examples: mods vs mod-packs
* jargon your kid has picked up from various youtubers may completely based off fantasy or of the streamer's inidividual experience. Their experience may be a way of exciting their fanbase, and some of their videos may be filled with more fiction than truth. Their content or language may not at all be derived from the Minecraft game -->
