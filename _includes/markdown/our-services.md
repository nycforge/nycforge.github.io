If your kids aren't getting to experience the luxuries of modded Minecraft - for instance, the advanced [let's plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFBkUc6tAPk) or [mod spotlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMmto9lZi5I) from direwolf20 - then maybe we can help...


To moms or dads... I'll travel throughout Brooklyn or Manhattan to setup your computer (mac or pc) so that it works flawlessly with any Minecraft mods. Think of me as an on-call Minecraft technician. I am available to help with obtaining and installing any applications/software/tools/utilities/necessities relating to Minecraft: 

* [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
* [MCEdit](http://www.mcedit.net/)
* [Curse](https://www.curse.com/download)
* [VoidLauncher](http://test.voidswrath.com/voidlauncher/)
* [FeedTheBeast](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/)

setting up skins and using skin editors:

* [minecraftskins.com](http://www.minecraftskins.com/skin-editor/)
* [minecraftskins.net](http://www.minecraftskins.net/skineditor)
* [minecraft.novaskin.me](https://minecraft.novaskin.me/)

downloading and setting up maps or other resources from sites such as:

* [planetminecraft.com](http://www.planetminecraft.com/resources/projects/)
* [minecraftsix.com](http://minecraftsix.com/category/minecraft-maps/)
* [planetminecraft.com](http://www.planetminecraft.com/resources/projects/)


...and if java difficulties are causeing you a headache, I can assist with that as well.

I am open to research and learn how to install other Minecraft releated tools that haven't already found their way to my list.

If your son or daughter is a proficient typist and interested in learning how to make their own Minecraft mods (using the forge api and eclipse), I could setup a modding environment on your computer and give them a few beginner lessons in Minecraft coding.

service specifics

As stated earlier, we encourage parents to tryout this service by providing free apointments to new customers. to encourage parents to take action.

<!-- `I couldn't get away sooner because my new well was coming in at Coyote Hills and I had to see about it. That well is now flowing at two thousand barrels and it's paying me an income of five thousand dollars a week. I have two others drilling and I have sixteen producing at Antelope; so, ladies and gentlemen, if I say I'm an oil man, you will agree. Now, you have a great chance here, but bear in mind, you can lose it all if you're not careful. Out of all men that beg for a chance to drill your lots, maybe one in twenty will be oilmen; the rest will be speculators - that's men trying to get between you and the oilmen - to get some of the money that ought by rights come to you. Even if you find one that has money and means to drill, he'll maybe know nothing about drilling and he'll have to hire the job out on contract, and then you're depending on a contractor who'll rush the job through so he can get another contract just as quick as he can. This is... the way that this works.
Man: Well, what is your offer? W-w-we're wasting time.
[crowd responds: "Yes." "Please."]
Plainview: I do my own drilling, and the men that work for me work for me. and they're men I know. I make it my business to be there and to see their work. I don't lose my tools in the hole and spend months fishing for them; I don't botch the cementing off and let water in the hole and ruin the whole lease. I'm a family man. I run a family business. This is my son and my partner, H.W. Plainview.
[indicates H.W]
Plainview: We offer you the bond of family that very few oilmen can understand. I'm fixed like no other company in this field and that's because my Coyote Hills well has just come in. I have a string of tools all ready to put to work. I can load a rig onto trucks and have them here in a week. I have business connections so I can get the lumber for the derrick - such things go by friendship in a rush like this - and this is why I can guarantee to start drilling and to put up the cash to back my word. I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, no matter what the others promise to do, when it comes to the showdown, they won't be there.`

Community service to help mom/dad.. not kids!

I will go travel to homes around the city and explain to parents how to install mods for minecraft. This will be a free service.

These parents may not be that interested in learning the intricacies of minecraft and modding. I will explain the greatest of mods and warn them of child stunt growth impending. Childs ability to navigate pc computer mods is synonomous with making network neural connections limiting brain growth.

If at any point they want me to come back and fix additional issues they are having, 60 an hour!

Two sides of a business card. Front side identifying with parent lack of ability to troubleshoot mod/mc issues. Back side catches eye of kid/gamer-youth. Totally minecraft relatable.
